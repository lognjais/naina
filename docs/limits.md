# What it cannot do

Read this before you deploy naina anywhere that matters. Everything here is
measured, and several of these were found the hard way.

## Script detection is automatic, in every binding

Pass `language="auto"` and naina picks the alphabet per image. It recognises a
sample of the highest-scoring detected boxes with each alphabet the registry
describes and keeps the best, provided it beats the default by a margin. The
chosen alphabet is reported back on the page, so it is never a silent guess.

Detection is script-agnostic and runs once, so this costs recognition on a
handful of strips rather than a second pass over the page.

That comparison is *relative*, on the same image, which is the only thing that
works. Measured: Cyrillic read with the wrong Devanagari model still scored
0.918, above any absolute cutoff that would catch Hindi-read-as-Latin at 0.511.
And on Latin input every alphabet ties near 0.98 because they all contain Latin,
so the default has to be displaced by a margin rather than merely beaten.

!!! warning "`auto` only considers alphabets already cached"
    It will not download every model to answer the question, that would mean
    88 MB where a named language needs 11 MB. On a build with no network in the
    core (browser, Android), stage the candidates first or name the language.

    The [web app](https://lognjais.github.io/naina/) handles this in two phases:
    read with the default, and only if the result is weak fetch the other
    alphabets and ask the core to decide. So a Latin document still costs 11 MB.

naina reads **Latin + CJK** by default, `auto` to detect, or any alphabet by
name:

```python
page = naina.read("hindi.png", language="devanagari")
```

Read a Devanagari page with the default alphabet and it does **not** fail, it
returns plausible-looking Latin. Measured on a real page: `3rarearanlus
Tarafaaa: f:` at **0.758 confidence**. With `language="devanagari"` the same page
returns `अयोध्याकाण्डे नवनवतितम: सग्गः` at 0.93.

CTC confidence measures certainty about the path chosen through the model's *own*
alphabet. It cannot express "these glyphs are not in my alphabet", so it stays
high and tells you nothing. **Do not use confidence to detect a script mismatch.**

An unknown language value is an error rather than a silent fallback:

```python
naina.read("x.png", language="klingon")   # raises; does not read as Latin
```

Ten alphabets ship: the default (Latin, Chinese, Japanese) plus `arabic`, `cyrillic`, `devanagari`, `el`, `eslav`, `korean`, `ta`, `te`, `th`.

!!! warning "Scripts outside that list behave as Hindi used to"
    Hebrew, Japanese kana-only, Vietnamese and others are not wired up. On those
    naina returns wrong text rather than an error. Upstream ships some of them in
    the same shape, so adding one is registry work.

## Handwriting is weak

PP-OCRv6 is trained on print. Claiming handwriting support would be dishonest.

## Layout degrades outside its training distribution

PP-DocLayout is trained on papers and reports and is excellent on them, 14 of 14
regions correctly labelled on an A4 academic page. On an unusual layout it can
mislabel a body paragraph as a title, which puts a whole paragraph under a `##`
heading in the markdown.

Text extraction is much more robust than structure. If you only need text, use
`page.lines` and ignore the markdown.

## One box can come back with two labels

PaddleDetection runs NMS per class, so the same region can be returned under
several labels and naina currently keeps every one above threshold. Measured: a
running head returned `text` at 0.677 *and* `header` at 0.481 for the identical
box.

When two labels for one box both clear the threshold, you get two regions. A
cross-class dedup pass is on the roadmap.

## Tables are detected, not parsed

A table region is located and labelled. Its cell structure is not extracted. The
markdown marks it explicitly rather than inventing a grid:

```
[table: structure not parsed]
```

That is deliberate. A plausible-looking wrong table is worse than an honest gap.

## Chart and formula contents are not interpreted

Same rule: regions get found and labelled, contents are not read.

## The browser is close to native, not bit-identical

naina guarantees **byte-identical output across bindings for one backend build**:
Python, Node and Rust run the same core against the same kernels.

WebAssembly is outside that guarantee, and this is measured rather than assumed.
`onnxruntime-web` is a different build of ONNX Runtime, using WASM SIMD kernels
instead of native NEON/AVX, so probability maps differ in the last few float bits.
On an A4 page at `tiny`:

| | Native macOS arm64 | Browser (WASM) |
|---|---|---|
| Text lines | 35 | 33 |
| Character-identical | | 33 |

One marginal blob landed on the other side of DBNet's 0.3 binarize threshold,
which changed line segmentation. Because a split fragment takes its own
reading-order slot, **word order can shift with it**.

What the browser does guarantee: determinism within itself (same input, same
output) and the same algorithms, since it runs the same C++.

## WebGPU is off by default because it silently breaks layout

Chrome 141 on an M3 initialises ONNX Runtime's JSEP (WebGPU) provider and then
fails a kernel:

```
[E:onnxruntime] Non-zero status code returned while running MatMul node.
Name:'MatMul.3' Status Message: Failed to run JSEP kernel
```

ORT recovers node by node, so text recognition still returned 33 lines at 0.99
confidence and the result *looked* correct. But layout detection returned **0
regions instead of 9**, and the markdown lost all its structure.

A silent quality regression is worse than a crash. naina defaults to `['wasm']`;
WebGPU is opt-in until there are real numbers.

## Not in scope, on purpose

- **Training or fine-tuning.** naina is inference only.
- **Autoregressive VLM parsing** (PaddleOCR-VL, DeepSeek-OCR). These need a
  tokenizer, KV cache and sampling loop, a different engine, not a module.
- **Face and person understanding.** naina v0.1 was this. It is preserved on the
  [`face-stack`](https://github.com/lognjais/naina/tree/face-stack) branch.
- Vector stores, dashboards, UI frameworks.
- Crime prediction, risk scoring, government-ID matching.

## Known build traps

**Backends default to OFF.** `NAINA_WITH_ONNXRUNTIME=OFF` produces a library with
no inference backend, and the suite still reports 100% green because every test
needing a backend *skips*. Set `NAINA_REQUIRE_BACKEND=1` to make those skips
fail.

**`FindNCNN.cmake` does not locate a Homebrew NCNN install**, so in practice only
the ONNX Runtime backend is exercised.
