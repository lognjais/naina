# Achroma + naina Adoption Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build `achroma`, a zero-dependency achromatic design system, and make naina's web app its first consumer — light-canonical, Geist, film grain, hairline structure — with every existing feature intact.

**Architecture:** Plain CSS custom properties in a new private repo published to npm as `achroma`. The neutral ramp is absolute and machine-checked to be chroma-zero; ~17 colour aliases re-point for dark mode. naina imports the file ahead of its own stylesheet; `main.ts`, `pages.ts` and `ocr.worker.ts` are never touched, so the OCR path cannot regress.

**Tech Stack:** CSS custom properties (OKLCH), Node 22 for tests (no test framework — `node:assert`), Geist Variable / Geist Mono Variable (OFL-1.1), Vite 6 for naina's app, Playwright for its e2e.

**Spec:** [`docs/design/specs/2026-07-30-achroma-design-system-design.md`](../specs/2026-07-30-achroma-design-system-design.md)

## Two repos

This plan spans two working directories. **Every task states which.**

| Path | Repo | State |
|---|---|---|
| `~/Documents/code/achroma` | `lognjais/achroma` | does not exist yet; created in Task 1 |
| `~/Documents/code/naina` | `lognjais/naina` | on branch `achroma-design-system` |

**Ordering constraint, non-negotiable:** naina's CI runs `actions/checkout@v4` then `npm install` in `app/` and checks out *only naina*. A `file:../../achroma` dependency resolves on a laptop and fails in Actions. So **Task 11 publishes `achroma@0.1.0` before Phase B begins.**

If you would rather not publish yet, Phase B can run against `npm install ../../achroma` — but that rewrites `app/package.json` to a `file:` path which **must not be committed**. Publishing first is the clean path.

## File structure

### New: `~/Documents/code/achroma`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | name `achroma`, `"dependencies": {}`, `exports` map, `files` allowlist |
| `achroma.css` | the entire system: ramp, aliases, semantics, type, space, radius, motion, `@font-face`, base layer, `.grain`, `.label` |
| `achroma.tailwind.css` | `@theme inline` bridge mapping shadcn's variable names onto Achroma. Written now, unused until cycle 3 |
| `fonts/*.woff2` | 6 vendored subsets |
| `proof.html` | every token rendered; the only way to review a token file |
| `test/oklch.mjs` | OKLCH → linear sRGB → WCAG luminance. Pure functions, no I/O |
| `test/oklch.test.mjs` | pins that math to the sRGB primaries |
| `test/contrast.mjs` | parses `achroma.css`; asserts chroma-zero, monotonicity, block parity, contrast table |
| `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` | private repo → public Pages, serving `proof.html` as index |
| `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` | usage; Apache-2.0 to match the org; OFL-1.1 font attribution |

`test/oklch.mjs` is split from `test/contrast.mjs` deliberately. The conversion math must itself be tested — a mistyped coefficient would not throw, it would return plausible contrast ratios that are wrong, and every ratio downstream would inherit the error. That is precisely the failure shape `CLAUDE.md` catalogues.

### Modified: `~/Documents/code/naina`

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `app/package.json` | add `"achroma": "^0.1.0"` |
| `app/index.html` | rewritten. Every id preserved; Google Fonts link removed; grain element added |
| `app/src/styles.css` | rewritten against tokens |

**Not touched:** `app/src/main.ts`, `app/src/pages.ts`, `app/src/ocr.worker.ts`, `app/public/sw.js`, every test.

### The DOM contract

`main.ts` resolves these by `getElementById`; the Playwright suites query them too. Renaming any is a defect:

```
#drop #file #tier #language #show-boxes #status #status-text #bar-fill
#pager #results #canvas #output #meta #error #offline-badge
#tab-md #tab-txt #tab-json #copy #download #download-all
.page-chip        ← a CLASS. e2e.mjs queries '#pager .page-chip'
```

`.page-chip` is the quiet one: every id failure throws at runtime in `main.ts`, but a `.page-chip` rename only fails in Playwright. Task 17 mutation-checks it.

# Phase A — the Achroma repo

## Task 1: Scaffold the repo

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/package.json`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/.gitignore`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/README.md`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/NOTICE`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the directory and initialise git**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/code/achroma/{fonts,test,.github/workflows}
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git init
```

Expected: `Initialized empty Git repository in .../achroma/.git/`

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `package.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "achroma",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "An achromatic design system. Black, white and greys, with hue reserved for meaning. Zero dependencies, plain CSS custom properties.",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "type": "module",
  "keywords": ["design-system", "design-tokens", "css", "achromatic", "monochrome", "greyscale"],
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/lognjais/achroma.git"
  },
  "homepage": "https://lognjais.github.io/achroma/",
  "exports": {
    "./achroma.css": "./achroma.css",
    "./achroma.tailwind.css": "./achroma.tailwind.css",
    "./fonts/*": "./fonts/*"
  },
  "files": ["achroma.css", "achroma.tailwind.css", "fonts", "NOTICE"],
  "sideEffects": ["*.css"],
  "dependencies": {},
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test/oklch.test.mjs && node test/contrast.mjs"
  }
}
```

`"dependencies": {}` is written explicitly rather than omitted — it is the promise the package makes, and an empty object states it where a missing key merely implies it.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `.gitignore`**

```
node_modules/
.DS_Store
_site/
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write `NOTICE`**

# achroma

An achromatic design system. Black, white and greys, with hue reserved for
meaning.

Zero dependencies. Plain CSS custom properties, no build step, no runtime. React,
Next, Vite, Astro and a bare `.html` file all consume the identical file.

Live token reference: <https://lognjais.github.io/achroma/>

## Install

```bash
npm i achroma
```

```css
@import 'achroma/achroma.css';
```

No tooling? `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/achroma@0/achroma.css">`

The major version is pinned deliberately. A copy-pasted `<link>` has no lockfile
and no way to notice a breaking token rename — it would just quietly lose its
styling.

Tailwind v4 + shadcn, additionally:

```css
@import 'achroma/achroma.tailwind.css';
```

## The two rules

1. **The ramp is absolute.** Every `--n-*` is chroma `0`, hue `0`, and identical
   in both modes. `npm test` fails if that stops being true.
2. **Aliases are what flip.** Dark mode re-points ~17 aliases at different ramp
   steps. It is not a second palette to keep in sync.

## Colour is never decoration

Hue appears only in `--danger-*`, `--warn-*` and `--ok-*`, and it never governs
content. Anything a user *chose* or a document *contains* is outside this system's
reach — a yellow highlighter has to be yellow, and a confidence heat-map has to
run green to amber.

Each semantic has three tokens because one cannot do three jobs: `-text` clears
4.5:1 on the page background, `-line` clears 3:1 for borders, `-bg` is a subtle
fill. Amber is why — `oklch(0.62 0.13 75)` on paper is 3.57:1, so an amber bright
enough to read as a warning border can never also be legible body text.

## Dark mode

Set nothing and it follows `prefers-color-scheme`. Class-based toggling (e.g.
next-themes) works too: `.dark` or `[data-theme='dark']`.

## Tokens

See `achroma.css` — it is the documentation. `proof.html` renders all of it.

## Task 2: The OKLCH math, test-first

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/test/oklch.mjs`
- Test: `~/Documents/code/achroma/test/oklch.test.mjs`

Everything downstream trusts these numbers, so they get pinned to known values first.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`test/oklch.test.mjs`:

```js
// Pins the OKLCH conversion to values that are not opinions.
//
// The sRGB primaries have exact OKLCH coordinates and exact WCAG luminances, so
// a wrong matrix coefficient shows up here rather than as a contrast ratio that
// looks reasonable and is wrong.

import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import { parseOklch, oklchToLinearSrgb, luminance, contrast } from './oklch.mjs';

let passed = 0;
const test = (name, fn) => {
  fn();
  passed++;
  console.log(`  ok  ${name}`);
};
const close = (actual, expected, tol, what) =>
  assert.ok(
    Math.abs(actual - expected) <= tol,
    `${what}: expected ${expected} ± ${tol}, got ${actual}`,
  );

test('parseOklch reads all three components', () => {
  assert.deepEqual(parseOklch('oklch(0.985 0 0)'), { L: 0.985, C: 0, h: 0 });
  assert.deepEqual(parseOklch('  oklch(0.5 0.19 27)  '), { L: 0.5, C: 0.19, h: 27 });
});

test('parseOklch returns null for anything else', () => {
  assert.equal(parseOklch('var(--n-25)'), null);
  assert.equal(parseOklch('#fafafa'), null);
  assert.equal(parseOklch('oklch(0.5 0.19)'), null);
});

test('white is luminance 1, black is luminance 0', () => {
  close(luminance(oklchToLinearSrgb({ L: 1, C: 0, h: 0 })), 1, 0.002, 'white');
  close(luminance(oklchToLinearSrgb({ L: 0, C: 0, h: 0 })), 0, 0.002, 'black');
});

test('the sRGB red primary round-trips', () => {
  const { r, g, b } = oklchToLinearSrgb({ L: 0.62796, C: 0.25768, h: 29.234 });
  close(r, 1, 0.01, 'red.r');
  close(g, 0, 0.01, 'red.g');
  close(b, 0, 0.01, 'red.b');
  close(luminance({ r, g, b }), 0.2126, 0.005, 'red luminance');
});

test('the sRGB green primary round-trips', () => {
  const { r, g, b } = oklchToLinearSrgb({ L: 0.86644, C: 0.29483, h: 142.495 });
  close(r, 0, 0.01, 'green.r');
  close(g, 1, 0.01, 'green.g');
  close(b, 0, 0.01, 'green.b');
  close(luminance({ r, g, b }), 0.7152, 0.005, 'green luminance');
});

test('the sRGB blue primary round-trips', () => {
  const { r, g, b } = oklchToLinearSrgb({ L: 0.45201, C: 0.31321, h: 264.052 });
  close(r, 0, 0.01, 'blue.r');
  close(g, 0, 0.01, 'blue.g');
  close(b, 1, 0.01, 'blue.b');
  close(luminance({ r, g, b }), 0.0722, 0.005, 'blue luminance');
});

test('black on white is 21:1', () => {
  close(contrast({ L: 0, C: 0, h: 0 }, { L: 1, C: 0, h: 0 }), 21, 0.05, 'max contrast');
});

test('contrast is symmetric', () => {
  const a = { L: 0.13, C: 0, h: 0 };
  const b = { L: 0.985, C: 0, h: 0 };
  assert.equal(contrast(a, b), contrast(b, a));
});

// The whole ramp relies on this identity: with chroma 0 the OKLab a and b terms
// vanish, l_ = m_ = s_ = L, and the linear-sRGB matrix rows sum to 1 — so
// luminance is exactly L cubed. It is what makes the ramp checkable by hand.
test('an achromatic colour has luminance L cubed', () => {
  for (const L of [0.09, 0.17, 0.52, 0.84, 0.922, 0.985]) {
    close(luminance(oklchToLinearSrgb({ L, C: 0, h: 0 })), L ** 3, 0.0005, `L=${L}`);
  }
});

console.log(`\n${passed} passed`);
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to confirm it fails**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
node test/oklch.test.mjs
```

Expected: `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../test/oklch.mjs'`

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

`test/oklch.mjs`:

```js
// OKLCH -> linear sRGB -> WCAG relative luminance.
//
// Hand-written because the alternative is a dependency in a package that
// promises none, and because these numbers decide whether the ramp ships. A

  if (!m) return null;
  return { L: Number(m[1]), C: Number(m[2]), h: Number(m[3]) };
}

  const l_ = L + 0.3963377774 * a + 0.2158037573 * b;
  const m_ = L - 0.1055613458 * a - 0.0638541728 * b;

```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run it to confirm it passes**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma

Expected: nine `ok` lines then `9 passed`. If a primary is off by more than the tolerance, a matrix coefficient is mistyped — fix the matrix, never the tolerance.

git commit -m "test: pin OKLCH-to-luminance conversion to the sRGB primaries"
```

### As shipped — five changes the review forced

The code above is the first draft. Review found two defects in it that mutation testing surfaced and inspection would not have. The files in the repo are authoritative; this records why they differ.

1. **Two tests could not fail.** Because `luminance` clamps, `white is luminance 1` and `black on white is 21:1` passed with a **49% error** in the largest matrix coefficient — the assertion read as "white is 1" but was really `min(1, anything) === 1`. Both now assert the raw pre-clamp channels from `oklchToLinearSrgb`. This is what kills the `r0 += 0.5` mutant, which now reports `got 1.5` — the number the clamp was hiding.

2. **`parseOklch` conflated two outcomes.** It returned `null` both for "not a colour, skip it" and "an `oklch()` I could not parse". Since Task 3 skips non-colours with `if (!c) continue;`, a token written as `oklch(0.55 0.16 25 / 0.12)` would have been swallowed and the suite would report every token passing with one never measured. That is the `Backend defaulted OFF` failure in this project's own table. It now **throws**, naming the offending value; `null` is reserved strictly for values that are not `oklch()` literals.

3. **`OKLCH(...)` was a second instance of the same hole.** CSS function names are ASCII case-insensitive, so uppercase *is* an `oklch()` literal, and it was returning `null`. Both patterns took an `i` flag — and a test, because the flag first landed unpinned.

4. **The `L³` tolerance was twelve orders of magnitude too loose.** That test's inputs are exact literals (`C=0` makes `cos(0)=1`, `sin(0)=0` exactly), so the "5-decimal input rounding sets a floor" argument that justifies `0.01` on the primaries has no purchase there. Measured error is `~3.3e-16`; tolerance is now `1e-12`, which is what kills the `+9e-4` coefficient mutant. **The primaries' `0.01`/`0.005` tolerances were correctly left alone.**

5. **Nothing asserted that every test ran.** `assert.equal(passed, 10)` now guards it — verified by deleting a test and getting `expected 10 tests to run, 9 did`.

**Residual gap, accepted deliberately.** The `a`/`b` chroma-path coefficients are pinned ~3 orders of magnitude more loosely than the row sums, because the only instruments touching them are the three primary tests at `0.01`. `sa` can be wrong by 1.95e-2 — a 22% relative error — and pass. Consequence is bounded: pushing every constant to its surviving bound moves the tightest semantic ratio to 3.53 against a 3.0 threshold. Closing it needs a source of exact high-chroma truth, not a tolerance change. Left open, and it is the reason the semantic margins in Task 5 matter.

---

## Task 3: The ramp assertions, test-first

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/test/contrast.mjs`

This runs before `achroma.css` exists, so it fails for the right reason first.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `test/contrast.mjs`**

```js
// Asserts the things about achroma.css that cannot be seen by reading it.
//
// Five classes of check, in order of how quietly they would otherwise fail:
//
//   1. chroma-zero    a stray 0.01 in the ramp is invisible by eye and would
//                     propagate to every site that installs this
//   2. block parity   the dark values are written twice (media query + class)
//                     and drift between the copies is undetectable by hand
//   3. monotonicity   a ramp step out of order makes "one step darker" a lie
//   4. gamut          an out-of-gamut hue reports a better ratio than it paints
//   5. contrast       computed, never assumed
//
// Prints every ratio whether it passes or not. A pass/fail line tells you less
// than the numbers do.
//
// Note on skips: parseOklch returns null only for values that are not oklch()
// literals at all, and throws for an oklch() it cannot measure (alpha, or a
// percentage lightness). So `if (!c) continue` below skips var() aliases and
// nothing else — an unmeasurable colour crashes the run rather than silently
// dropping out of the report.

// channel is -0.1252, clamping lifts it to Y = 0.2256, and it claims 3.65:1
// where the in-gamut colour manages 3.57:1.
//
// So a chromatic token that passes its threshold while out of gamut is a false
// pass — precisely the shape this file exists to prevent. The ramp cannot hit
// this (chroma 0 and L in [0,1] always lands in gamut), which is why the check
// is scoped to tokens that actually carry hue.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to confirm it fails for the right reason**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
node test/contrast.mjs
```

Expected: `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.../achroma.css'`

That is the correct failure. If it prints contrast numbers, something is wrong.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add test/contrast.mjs
git commit -m "test: assert chroma-zero, ramp order, dark-block parity, gamut and contrast"
```

### As shipped — one addition, and two constraints on Task 5

The file was written verbatim as specified and fixture-tested against the good path (28 targets passing) plus seven mutations, all caught. One assertion was added afterwards, and two structural constraints on `achroma.css` came out of that testing.

**Added: the gamut check's hidden coupling is now asserted.** The gamut loop does `if (!c) continue`, which is only safe because every chromatic token *also* appears in `TARGETS`, where an unresolvable value is a loud `cannot resolve` failure. That invariant was real but unenforced — a chromatic alias added to `COLOUR_ALIASES` and forgotten in `TARGETS` would have become gamut-skippable with nothing to notice. Now checked, and verified load-bearing: silent at baseline, fires when `--ok-line` is dropped from `TARGETS`.

**Constraint 1 — `blocks()` sweeps everything between two markers, not just `:root`.** Only `--custom-property` declarations match, so ordinary properties are ignored, but a rule like `.foo { --bg: … }` between markers would fold into that block's map and could shadow a contract name. **Task 5 must keep all component CSS after the last `@achroma` marker**, and nothing after it may redefine one of the 17 alias names. The `prefers-reduced-motion` block that re-points `--dur-*` is fine — those are not colour aliases and no check reads them.

**Constraint 2 — the two dark blocks must be declaration-identical, not merely equivalent.** The parity check compares raw declaration strings, so `var(--n-850)` and `oklch(0.220 0 0)` count as disagreeing even though they resolve to the same colour. Write the dark-class block as a literal copy of the media-query block.

## Task 4: Vendor the fonts

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/fonts/` (6 `.woff2`)

- [ ] **Step 1: Extract the six subsets**

```bash
cd /tmp && rm -rf achroma-fonts && mkdir achroma-fonts && cd achroma-fonts
npm pack @fontsource-variable/geist@5.3.0 @fontsource-variable/geist-mono@5.3.0
for t in *.tgz; do tar xzf "$t"; mv package "${t%.tgz}"; done
cp fontsource-variable-geist-5.3.0/files/geist-latin-wght-normal.woff2 \
   fontsource-variable-geist-5.3.0/files/geist-latin-ext-wght-normal.woff2 \
   fontsource-variable-geist-5.3.0/files/geist-cyrillic-wght-normal.woff2 \
   fontsource-variable-geist-mono-5.3.0/files/geist-mono-latin-wght-normal.woff2 \
   fontsource-variable-geist-mono-5.3.0/files/geist-mono-latin-ext-wght-normal.woff2 \
   fontsource-variable-geist-mono-5.3.0/files/geist-mono-cyrillic-wght-normal.woff2 \
   ~/Documents/code/achroma/fonts/
ls -la ~/Documents/code/achroma/fonts/
```

Expected: 6 files. Italics are skipped — an editorial achromatic system leans on weight, not slant.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the licence is what NOTICE claims**

```bash
grep -c "SIL Open Font License" /tmp/achroma-fonts/fontsource-variable-geist-5.3.0/LICENSE
```

Expected: a count `>= 1`. This was verified as OFL-1.1 on 2026-07-30; re-checking costs a second and the `NOTICE` file asserts it.

- [ ] **Step 3: Force binary handling for the fonts**

Create `~/Documents/code/achroma/.gitattributes`:

```
*.woff2 binary
```

Git's auto-detection usually classifies compressed fonts correctly, but a font
that is silently corrupted by a line-ending conversion still commits and still
diffs as "fine" — and only shows up as the system fallback rendering in a
browser. This is a one-line guard against exactly that class of quiet failure.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the files are intact after adding them**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
file fonts/*.woff2 | head -6
```

Expected: every line reports `Web Open Font Format (Version 2)`. Anything else — `data`, `ASCII text` — means the file was mangled in transit.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add .gitattributes fonts/
git commit -m "chore: vendor Geist and Geist Mono subsets (OFL-1.1)"
```

---

## Task 5: `achroma.css`

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/achroma.css`

### Three authoring rules the test file imposes

`test/contrast.mjs` parses this file with regexes rather than a CSS parser — a deliberate trade to keep the package dependency-free. That puts three constraints on how the CSS may be written. All three fail **silently**, which is why they are stated before the code rather than discovered after.

**1. The film-grain data URI must stay inline in `background-image`, and must use the comma form.** `decls()` matches `/(--[a-z0-9-]+)\s*:\s*([^;]+);/g` — it only sees custom properties, so a data URI in an ordinary property is invisible to it and safe. Verified empirically:

| Form | Parsed as |
|---|---|
| `background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg…")` | not matched at all — **safe** |
| `--grain: url("data:image/svg+xml;base64,…")` | `url("data:image/svg+xml` — **silently truncated** |
| `--grain: url("data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg/>")` | `url("data:image/svg+xml` — **silently truncated** |

So: never tokenise the grain URL into a custom property, and never use the `;base64` or `;utf8` variants. Neighbouring tokens survive intact in every case, so nothing would look broken — only the grain would quietly stop working.

**2. All component CSS goes after the last `@achroma` marker,** and nothing after it may redefine one of the 17 colour aliases. `blocks()` sweeps everything between two markers, so a rule like `.foo { --bg: … }` placed between them folds into that mode's token map and shadows the contract. The `prefers-reduced-motion` block that re-points `--dur-*` is fine — those are not colour aliases and no check reads them.

**3. The two dark blocks must be declaration-identical, character for character.** The parity check compares raw declaration strings, so `var(--n-850)` and `oklch(0.220 0 0)` register as disagreeing even though they resolve to the same colour. Write the second block as a literal copy of the first.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the file**

```css
/* Achroma — an achromatic design system.
 *
 * Black, white and greys, with hue reserved for meaning. Plain CSS custom
 * properties: no build step, no runtime, zero dependencies.
 *
 * Two rules hold this together:
 *
 *   1. The ramp is absolute. Every --n-* is chroma 0, hue 0, identical in both
 *      modes. test/contrast.mjs fails if that stops being true, because a stray
 *      0.01 is invisible by eye and would reach every site that installs this.
 *
 *   2. Aliases are what flip. Dark mode re-points 17 aliases at different ramp
 *      steps — it is not a second palette to keep in sync.
 *
 * Colour is never decoration. It appears only in --danger/--warn/--ok, and it
 * never governs content a user chose or a document contains.
 *
 * The @achroma marker comments are parsed by test/contrast.mjs. Do not remove
 * them.
 */

/* ── fonts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Self-hosted, not Google Fonts: consumers of this system claim to work
 * offline, and a CDN webfont would break that claim quietly.
 *
 * Family names are exact. 'Geist Variable' and 'Geist Mono Variable' — the word
 * order on the mono is easy to reverse, and getting it wrong falls back to the
 * system monospace silently.
 *
 * Geist covers latin, latin-ext and cyrillic. It does NOT cover Devanagari,
 * Arabic, Greek, Korean, Tamil, Telugu or Thai; the fallback chain on
 * --font-mono is what handles those, per-glyph.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the assertions**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
node test/contrast.mjs
```

Expected: a light table and a dark table of ratios, then `all ramp assertions passed`.

**If anything reports FAIL, retune the token and re-run — never lower the target.**

The `-line` tokens on light are the tight ones, because yellow and green carry a lot of luminance and `3:1` against near-white paper is demanding. `--warn-line` and `--ok-line` were already pulled down from `0.72` and `0.62` to `0.66` and `0.58` for exactly this reason, and they may still be marginal. Drop `L` in 0.02 steps until each clears. `--danger-line` has headroom (red is dark) and should pass at `0.62`.

Retuning `L` is always the right lever; reducing `C` desaturates toward the neutrals and blurs the signal-versus-decoration line the system depends on.

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the achromatic assertion is load-bearing**

Break it deliberately, confirm the test catches it, put it back:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
sed -i '' 's/--n-500: oklch(0.620 0 0);/--n-500: oklch(0.620 0.01 250);/' achroma.css
node test/contrast.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=1`, with `--n-500: chroma must be exactly 0, got 0.01 — this is not achromatic`.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
sed -i '' 's/--n-500: oklch(0.620 0.01 250);/--n-500: oklch(0.620 0 0);/' achroma.css
node test/contrast.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=0`. A test that cannot fail is not evidence.

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify the dark-block parity assertion is load-bearing**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
sed -i '' '/@achroma dark-class/,$ s/--fg-dim: var(--n-400);/--fg-dim: var(--n-500);/' achroma.css
node test/contrast.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=1`, with `dark blocks disagree on --fg-dim`.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
sed -i '' '/@achroma dark-class/,$ s/--fg-dim: var(--n-500);/--fg-dim: var(--n-400);/' achroma.css
node test/contrast.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=0`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add achroma.css
git commit -m "feat: the token system — absolute ramp, mode-flipping aliases, grain"
```

## Task 6: The Tailwind bridge

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/achroma.tailwind.css`

Written now, unused until the `tool` cycle. It exists so that cycle is a two-line change rather than a rediscovery.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the file**

```css
/* Achroma -> Tailwind v4 + shadcn bridge.
 *
 * Import after achroma.css. Maps shadcn's semantic variable names onto Achroma
 * tokens so Radix components inherit the system without any edits to their own
 * files.
 *
 *   @import 'achroma/achroma.css';
 *   @import 'achroma/achroma.tailwind.css';
 *
 * Unused by naina — naina is plain CSS. This is for consumers on Tailwind.
 */

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--bg);
  --color-foreground: var(--fg);
  --color-card: var(--bg-raised);
  --color-card-foreground: var(--fg);
  --color-popover: var(--bg-raised);
  --color-popover-foreground: var(--fg);

  /* Interaction is ink, not a hue. This is the line that makes a shadcn app
   * achromatic — --primary is where its accent colour lived. */
  --color-primary: var(--fg);
  --color-primary-foreground: var(--bg);
  --color-secondary: var(--bg-sunken);
  --color-secondary-foreground: var(--fg);
  --color-muted: var(--bg-sunken);
  --color-muted-foreground: var(--fg-dim);
  --color-accent: var(--bg-sunken);
  --color-accent-foreground: var(--fg);

  --color-destructive: var(--danger-text);
  --color-destructive-foreground: var(--n-0);

  --color-border: var(--hairline);
  --color-input: var(--rule);
  --color-ring: var(--fg);

  --font-sans: var(--font-sans);
  --font-mono: var(--font-mono);

  --radius-sm: var(--r-sm);
  --radius-md: var(--r-md);
  --radius-lg: var(--r-lg);
  --radius-xl: var(--r-lg);
}
```

Note what is deliberately absent: `--chart-1` through `--chart-5`. Series in an achromatic system cannot be told apart by hue, so charts need a lightness ramp plus pattern differentiation — a real problem that belongs in the `tool` cycle with the `dataviz` skill, not a blind five-grey substitution here.

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add achroma.tailwind.css
git commit -m "feat: Tailwind v4 + shadcn bridge, for the tool cycle"
```

## Task 7: `proof.html`

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/proof.html`

A token file cannot be reviewed by reading it. This is the review surface.

- [ ] **Step 2: Serve and look at it**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
python3 -m http.server 8099 &
open http://localhost:8099/proof.html

Check: every ramp swatch is a neutral grey with no colour cast; the display line is thin, not bold; grain is visible as texture but not as noise; the three semantic blocks are legible.

Then switch the OS appearance to dark and reload. Then zoom to 200%.

```bash
kill %1
```

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add proof.html
git commit -m "feat: proof.html — the review surface for a file you cannot read"

## Task 8: The Pages workflow

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the workflow**

```yaml
name: Deploy web app to GitHub Pages

# Publishes proof.html as lognjais.github.io/achroma/ — the living token
# reference.
#
# No build step: achroma is plain CSS. The artifact is proof.html renamed to
# index.html, the stylesheet, and the fonts.

on:
  push:
    branches: [master, main]
    paths:
      - 'achroma.css'
      - 'proof.html'
      - 'fonts/**'
      - '.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml'
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: pages
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'

      # The ramp assertions gate the deploy. A site that documents tokens which
      # fail their own contrast targets is worse than no site.
      - name: Assert the ramp
        run: npm test

      - name: Assemble the artifact
        run: |
          mkdir -p _site/fonts
          cp proof.html _site/index.html
          cp achroma.css _site/
          cp fonts/*.woff2 _site/fonts/
          touch _site/.nojekyll
          echo "total: $(du -sh _site | cut -f1)"

      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: _site

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm `npm test` runs both suites**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
npm test
```

Expected: the 9 `oklch` oks, then both contrast tables, then `all ramp assertions passed`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add .github/workflows/deploy-web.yml
git commit -m "ci: publish proof.html to Pages, gated on the ramp assertions"
```

---

## Task 9: Create the remote and push

**Files:** none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the public repo and push**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
gh repo create lognjais/achroma --public \
  --description "An achromatic design system. Zero dependencies, plain CSS custom properties." \
  --homepage "https://lognjais.github.io/achroma/" \
  --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

Expected: the repo URL, then a push summary.

- [ ] **Step 2: Enable Pages**

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/lognjais/achroma/pages -f build_type=workflow 2>&1 | head -5
gh workflow run deploy-web.yml --repo lognjais/achroma
```

Pages needs no paid plan on a public repo. If the POST reports the site already exists, that is fine — proceed to the workflow run.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm nothing private leaked into a now-public repo**

The repo was scaffolded before this became public, so check rather than assume:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git log --all --format='%H' | while read sha; do git ls-tree -r --name-only "$sha"; done | sort -u
```

Expected: only the files this plan created. No `.env`, no keys, no `node_modules`, nothing from another project.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the workflow went green**

```bash
sleep 45 && gh run list --repo lognjais/achroma --limit 3
```

Expected: a `completed` / `success` run. If it failed, read the log before proceeding: `gh run view --repo lognjais/achroma --log-failed`.

---

## Task 10: Review gate

**Files:** none. **Stop here and get sign-off.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Present `proof.html` for review**

Confirm with the user, before publishing anything to npm:

- the ramp reads as neutral in both modes, with no colour cast
- the thin display type is the intended character
- the grain is right at `--grain-opacity` — this is the one value most likely to want taste applied
- the three semantics are distinguishable and legible

Task 11 publishes to npm. **npm versions cannot be unpublished after 72 hours and the unscoped name `achroma` is a one-time claim** — which is why this gate exists.

---

## Task 11: Publish `achroma@0.1.0`

**Files:** none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Confirm what will ship**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
npm pack --dry-run
```

Expected: `achroma.css`, `achroma.tailwind.css`, 6 files under `fonts/`, `NOTICE`, `README.md`, `package.json`. **`test/` and `proof.html` must be absent** — they are not part of the contract.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the name is still free**

```bash
npm view achroma version 2>&1 | head -2
```

Expected: an `E404`. Anything else means the name was taken since 2026-07-30 — stop and switch to `@jvoltci/achroma`, which was also verified free.

- [ ] **Step 3: Publish**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
npm publish --access public
```

Expected: `+ achroma@0.1.0`

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify it installs clean from the registry**

```bash
cd /tmp && rm -rf achroma-install-probe && mkdir achroma-install-probe && cd achroma-install-probe
npm init -y >/dev/null && npm i achroma
node -e "console.log(require('fs').readFileSync('node_modules/achroma/achroma.css','utf8').length + ' bytes')"
ls node_modules/achroma/fonts/ | wc -l
```

Expected: a byte count, and `6`. This checks the `files` allowlist actually carried the fonts — a package whose CSS references fonts it did not ship fails silently, as a fallback to system sans.

- [ ] **Step 5: Tag the release**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags
```

---

# Phase B — naina adopts Achroma

All remaining tasks are in `~/Documents/code/naina` on branch `achroma-design-system`.

## Task 12: Wire the dependency

**Files:**
- Modify: `app/package.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Install**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
npm i achroma
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm it is a registry dependency, not a path**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
grep '"achroma"' package.json
```

Expected: `"achroma": "^0.1.0"`. **If this shows a `file:` path, stop** — it will resolve locally and fail in CI.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina
git add app/package.json app/package-lock.json
git commit -m "build(app): depend on achroma"
```

---

## Task 13: Rewrite `app/index.html`

**Files:**
- Modify: `app/index.html`

Every id in the DOM contract is preserved. The Google Fonts link goes (fonts now ship with Achroma, and the app claims to work offline). The grain element is added.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the file**

              Detection post-processing, text decoding, reading order and markdown

              Handwriting is weak, and scripts outside PP-OCRv6's character set
              (Devanagari among them) come back as confident nonsense rather than
              an error. Latin and CJK print are its strengths.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify no id was lost**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
for id in drop file tier language show-boxes status status-text bar-fill pager \
          results canvas output meta error offline-badge tab-md tab-txt tab-json \
          copy download download-all; do
  grep -q "id=\"$id\"" index.html || echo "MISSING: #$id"
done
echo "id check done"
```

Expected: `id check done` with no `MISSING` lines.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina
git add app/index.html
git commit -m "feat(app): restructure markup for Achroma, drop the webfont request"

## Task 14: Rewrite `app/src/styles.css`

**Files:**
- Modify: `app/src/styles.css`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the file**

```css
/* naina web app — Achroma.
 *
 * Every colour, size, radius and duration is a token. A hardcoded value here is
 * a bug: it means the design system is missing something, and the next site will
 * hit the same gap.
 *
 * The one deliberate exception is the confidence overlay drawn on the canvas by
 * main.ts, which runs green to amber by line confidence. That is data, not
 * decoration — deleting it would remove the signal that tells a reader which
 * lines to distrust.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Build**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
npm run build
```

Expected: `tsc --noEmit` clean, then a Vite build summary. A failure to resolve `achroma/achroma.css` means the `exports` map in Task 1 is wrong.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm the fonts were bundled, not fetched**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
ls dist/assets/*.woff2 | wc -l
grep -rl "fonts.googleapis\|fonts.gstatic" dist/ | head -3
```

Expected: a non-zero woff2 count, and **no output** from the grep. A Google Fonts reference in `dist/` would break the offline claim quietly.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina
git add app/src/styles.css
git commit -m "feat(app): restyle onto Achroma tokens"
```

---

## Task 15: Verify the app still works

**Files:** none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the e2e suite**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
NAINA_E2E_IMAGE=$(ls test/*.png 2>/dev/null | head -1) node test/e2e.mjs
```

If no fixture image exists in `test/`, point `NAINA_E2E_IMAGE` at any page screenshot. Expected: every `ok` line, no failures.

- [ ] **Step 2: Check the shape of the output, not that output appeared**

The suite asserts text came back. Read the `#meta` line it prints and confirm **line count, region count and mean confidence are all non-zero.** A read returning 33 lines at 0.99 with zero layout regions is a regression this suite would otherwise pass.

- [ ] **Step 3: Mutation-check `.page-chip`**

This is the one contract element that fails quietly, so prove the assertion is real:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
sed -i '' 's/^\.page-chip {/.page-chip-renamed {/' src/styles.css
npm run build >/dev/null 2>&1
NAINA_E2E_IMAGE=$(ls test/*.png 2>/dev/null | head -1) node test/e2e.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```

Expected: `exit=1`. The class only styles chips — `main.ts` still sets the class name, so the *selector* count in Playwright is what must not change. If this passes, the pager assertion is not load-bearing and the e2e suite needs fixing before you trust it.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
sed -i '' 's/^\.page-chip-renamed {/.page-chip {/' src/styles.css
npm run build >/dev/null 2>&1
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit nothing; report**

No code changed in this task. If step 3 did not fail as expected, stop and say so rather than proceeding.

---

## Task 16: Verify non-Latin output is still legible

**Files:** none.

Geist covers latin, latin-ext and cyrillic. Devanagari, Arabic, Greek, Korean, Tamil, Telugu and Thai fall back per-glyph. This is the check that the fallback chain works rather than rendering boxes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the Hindi check**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
node test/hindi-check.mjs
```

Expected: the `#meta` and `#output` contents. **Confirm actual Devanagari characters appear in the output** — not `?`, not `□`, not Latin transliteration.

- [ ] **Step 2: Confirm the glyphs render rather than merely existing in the DOM**

Text can be present in the DOM and still draw as tofu boxes. Screenshot the output pane and look at it:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
node -e "
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const b = await chromium.launch();
  const p = await b.newPage();
  await p.goto('http://localhost:4173/');
  await p.evaluate(() => {
    document.getElementById('results').hidden = false;
    document.getElementById('output').textContent =
      'नैना — देवनागरी\nΕλληνικά\nالعربية\nதமிழ்\nతెలుగు\nไทย\n한국어\nРусский';
  });
  await p.locator('#output').screenshot({ path: 'scripts-check.png' });
  await b.close();
})();
"
open scripts-check.png
```

Run `npm run preview` in another shell first. Expected: eight legible lines, no boxes. Delete `scripts-check.png` afterwards.

---

## Task 17: Look at all four states

**Files:** none.

The browser suites cannot judge whether it looks right.

- [ ] **Step 1: Serve the build**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina/app
npm run preview
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Check each state**

- **Light** (default) — display type thin, hairlines visible but not glaring, grain present as texture
- **Dark** — switch the OS appearance and reload. Confirm the caveat and error blocks are still legible, and that the checkerboard behind a transparent image has not inverted into something loud
- **900px wide** — results collapse to one column; the pane heads still fit
- **200% zoom** — the grain must not show tiling seams; this is the only place a bad noise texture is obvious

- [ ] **Step 3: Run a real document end to end**

Drop a multi-page PDF. Confirm: the pager appears, chips are clickable, a failed page still gets a chip in `--danger-text`, `Save all` appears, `Copy` flips to `Copied`, and the confidence overlay still draws **green to amber** — that colour is data and must not have gone neutral.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit any tuning**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina
git add -A app/
git commit -m "style(app): tune spacing and weight after looking at it"
```

Skip if nothing changed.

## Task 18: Update the spec's status

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/design/specs/2026-07-30-achroma-design-system-design.md:3`

- [ ] **Step 1: Change the status line**

Replace:

```markdown
**Status:** designed, not implemented.
```

with:

```markdown
**Status:** implemented for Achroma and naina. The `tool` cycle is still open.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/naina
git add docs/design/specs/2026-07-30-achroma-design-system-design.md
git commit -m "docs: mark the Achroma spec implemented for naina"
```

---

# Phase C — documentation (last)

Deliberately last, so the docs describe what shipped rather than what was planned. Scope is naina's: mkdocs-material, a handful of pages, no bespoke site. `proof.html` remains the live token reference at `lognjais.github.io/achroma/`; these pages land at `/achroma/doc/`, mirroring naina's `/naina/doc/` split exactly.

## Task 19: Documentation pages

**Files:**
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/mkdocs.yml`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/docs/index.md`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/docs/tokens.md`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/docs/dark-mode.md`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/docs/tailwind.md`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/docs/recipes.md`
- Create: `~/Documents/code/achroma/docs/assets/extra.css`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `mkdocs.yml`**

Two deliberate departures from naina's config, both because this is an achromatic system documenting itself:

```yaml
site_name: achroma
site_description: An achromatic design system. Black, white and greys, with hue reserved for meaning. Zero dependencies.
site_url: https://lognjais.github.io/achroma/doc/
repo_url: https://github.com/lognjais/achroma
repo_name: lognjais/achroma
edit_uri: edit/master/docs/

docs_dir: docs

theme:
  name: material
  language: en

      - Tokens: tokens.md
  - Use it:

      - Tailwind and shadcn: tailwind.md
      - Recipes: recipes.md

extra:
  social:
    - icon: fontawesome/brands/github
      link: https://github.com/lognjais/achroma

extra_css:
  - assets/extra.css
```

Note `accent: grey`, not naina's `accent: blue`. A design system that forbids decorative hue should not ship docs with a blue accent.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `docs/assets/extra.css`**

Declares the vendored Geist for the docs chrome and re-points mkdocs-material's own type variables. Keep it to this — do not restyle the theme.

```css
/* The docs use the system they document. Fonts are the vendored copies, not
   Google Fonts, for the same reason the package self-hosts them. Paths resolve
   because the deploy workflow copies fonts/ alongside the built docs. */

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Geist Variable';
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 100 900;
  src: url('../fonts/geist-latin-wght-normal.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Geist Mono Variable';
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 100 900;
  src: url('../fonts/geist-mono-latin-wght-normal.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
}

:root {
  --md-text-font: 'Geist Variable', system-ui, sans-serif;
  --md-code-font: 'Geist Mono Variable', ui-monospace, monospace;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `docs/index.md`**

Cover, in this order: what achroma is in two sentences; install (`npm i achroma`, the `@import`, the pinned unpkg `<link>`); the two rules (ramp is absolute, aliases flip); the "colour is never decoration" rule including the interface-versus-content distinction with both worked examples (a yellow highlighter has to be yellow; a confidence heat-map has to run green to amber); and a link to `proof.html` as the live reference. Link `tokens.md` for the full table.

State plainly that the ramp's chroma-zero property and every contrast target are machine-asserted by `npm test`, and that this is what makes the claims checkable rather than aspirational.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write `docs/tokens.md`**

The reference page. This is the one that has to be genuinely good, because it is what anyone integrating will actually read. Include:

- The 16-step ramp as a table: token, OKLCH value, and its relative luminance (`Y = L³`), with a sentence explaining why that identity holds for achromatic colours.
- The 17 colour aliases as a table: token, light ramp step, dark ramp step, and what it is for. Mark which ones have asserted contrast targets and what those targets are.
- The 9 semantic tokens: token, both modes' values, measured contrast, and the `-text` / `-line` / `-bg` division of labour. Include the amber finding — `oklch(0.62 0.13 75)` on paper is 3.57:1, which is why one token per semantic is not enough.
- Type, space, radius and motion tokens as four short tables.
- A closing "how to add a token" note: chroma must be 0 for neutrals, and any chromatic token must be added to both `COLOUR_ALIASES` and `TARGETS` in `test/contrast.mjs` or the gamut check will silently skip it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `docs/dark-mode.md`**

How it works with no configuration (`prefers-color-scheme`), how to force a mode (`[data-theme='light']` / `.light`), and how class-based toggling works for next-themes (`.dark`). Explain that the dark values are written twice on purpose and that `test/contrast.mjs` asserts the two copies agree — because nothing else would catch them drifting.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write `docs/tailwind.md`**

The `achroma.tailwind.css` bridge: what to import and in what order, the full mapping table from shadcn's variable names to Achroma tokens, and the note that `--primary` becomes ink rather than a hue, which is the single line that makes a shadcn app achromatic. State clearly what the bridge does **not** provide and why — chart colours, because series cannot be distinguished by hue in an achromatic system and that needs a lightness ramp plus pattern differentiation rather than five greys.

- [ ] **Step 7: Write `docs/recipes.md`**

Copy-paste patterns, each a short CSS block: a card on a raised surface, a filled ink button and its hover, an input with a focus ring, a hairline-separated list, an uppercase mono micro-label, the grain overlay element, and a semantic callout using the three-token set. Keep each to the minimum that demonstrates the token usage.

- [ ] **Step 8: Build it locally and check every link resolves**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
pip install --quiet mkdocs-material
mkdocs build --strict --site-dir /tmp/achroma-doc-check
```

Expected: a clean build. `--strict` turns broken internal links and nav references into errors, so a green build is the check. Then confirm the fonts referenced by `extra.css` will resolve at the deployed paths — the workflow in Task 20 is what places them.

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/achroma-doc-check
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add mkdocs.yml docs/
git commit -m "docs: mkdocs-material reference at /achroma/doc/"
```

---

## Task 20: Deploy the docs alongside proof.html

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/Documents/code/achroma/.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml`

- [ ] **Step 1: Add a docs build step**

Insert after the artifact-assembly step from Task 8, mirroring naina's approach of building docs into a subdirectory of the same Pages artifact:

```yaml
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Build docs into /doc
        run: |
          pip install --quiet mkdocs-material
          mkdocs build --strict --site-dir _site/doc
          # extra.css references ../fonts/, which resolves from _site/doc/ to
          # the fonts already copied into _site/ by the assemble step.
          echo "doc: $(du -sh _site/doc | cut -f1)"
```

Also extend the workflow's `paths:` trigger to include `docs/**` and `mkdocs.yml`, or a docs-only change will not deploy.

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the font paths actually resolve**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
test -f _site/fonts/geist-latin-wght-normal.woff2 && echo "fonts present at _site/fonts/"
```

Run this against a local reproduction of the assemble step. `extra.css` at `_site/doc/assets/extra.css` references `../fonts/…`, which resolves to `_site/doc/fonts/` — **not** `_site/fonts/`. Check this rather than assuming: if it does not resolve, either copy the fonts into `_site/doc/fonts/` as well or correct the relative path to `../../fonts/`. A wrong path here fails silently, as the docs falling back to system sans.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/code/achroma
git add .github/workflows/deploy-web.yml
git commit -m "ci: build the docs into /doc on the same Pages artifact"
```

---

## Self-review notes

**Spec coverage.** Every section of the spec maps to a task: vocabulary and decisions → the README in Task 1; the ramp and aliases → Task 5; semantics ×3 → Task 5; the interface-vs-content rule → the comment headers in Tasks 5 and 14 plus the overlay check in Task 17 step 3; token inventory → Task 5; architecture and the two consumers → Tasks 5, 6 and 12; fonts → Tasks 4 and 5; the four verification items → Tasks 2, 3, 5 (steps 3–4), 15, 16 and 17; the ordering constraint → Task 11 before Task 12.

**Deliberately deferred, per the spec's "Out of scope":** the `tool` adoption and its 685 utility occurrences, the achromatic chart treatment, the mkdocs docs site, and `tool`'s two pre-existing bugs. None of these are in this plan.

**Known gap.** `--fg-faint` is asserted at ≥3:1 and is therefore valid for non-text and large text only, but it is used for `.meta`, `.drop-hint` and the footer at `--text-2xs` and `--text-xs` — which are small. Those are secondary, non-essential strings, so this is a considered trade rather than an oversight; if a reviewer disagrees, the fix is to move them to `--fg-dim` and re-run Task 5 step 2. Flagged here rather than left to be discovered.
