**[Use it in your browser now →](https://lognjais.github.io/naina/)** No install, no
upload, no account. PDFs and images, in ten scripts.

## Scripts

| `language` | Reads |
|---|---|
| *(default)* | Latin, Chinese, Japanese |
| `arabic` | Arabic, Persian, Urdu |
| `cyrillic` | Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian, Mongolian |
| `devanagari` | Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit |
| `el` | Greek |
| `eslav` | Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian |
| `korean` | Korean |
| `ta` | Tamil |
| `te` | Telugu |
| `th` | Thai |

```python
page = naina.read("invoice.png", language="devanagari")
```

A tier picks model *size*; a language picks the *alphabet*. Detection and layout
are script-agnostic and shared, so a language costs one 8 MB model rather than
three.

> **Choosing wrong is silent.** Read a Hindi page with the default alphabet and it
> returns fluent-looking Latin at ~0.75 confidence, not an error, confidence
> measures certainty *within* the model's own alphabet and cannot express "wrong
> alphabet". An unrecognised `language` value **does** raise.

> **v0.2.1 is out on all five registries**: PyPI, npm ×2, crates.io and pub.dev.
> The web app and docs are live.

## Packages

| Package | Registry | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| `naina` | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/naina/) | Python, self-contained wheels | ✅ **published** |
| `naina` | [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/naina) | Rust over the C ABI | ✅ **published** |
| `@jvoltci/naina` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jvoltci/naina) | Node, inference off the event loop | ✅ **published** |
| `@jvoltci/naina-wasm` | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jvoltci/naina-wasm) | Browser, 143 KB brotli | ✅ **published** |
| `naina` | [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/naina) | Flutter, FFI | ✅ **published**, Android verified on a device, iOS unproven |
| | | [MCP server](mcp/) for LLM tools | works, in-repo |

Packages are scoped because unscoped `naina` on npm belongs to another project.

> **npm tokens expire.** A granular token with write access lasts **90 days at
> most**, so a token-based release breaks on a timer. Both npm jobs already
> request `id-token: write`, so switching these packages to npm's Trusted
> Publishing is a matter of configuring it on each package and deleting the
> `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` lines. Worth doing before the current token lapses.

```python
import naina
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

img = np.asarray(Image.open("invoice.png").convert("RGB"))

# One-liner: image -> markdown
print(naina.read(img))

# Or keep an Engine around
engine = naina.Engine(tier=naina.Tier.SMALL)
page = engine.read(img)
for line in page.lines:
    print(f"{line.confidence:.3f}  {line.text}")
```

## Why

OCR accuracy is a solved commodity. PP-OCRv6's weights are Apache-2.0, so naina
runs the same models PaddleOCR runs and gets the same accuracy. Competing there
is unwinnable and pointless.

The gap is **distribution**. Every existing tool is locked into one lane:

| Tool | Lane | Cannot do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PaddleOCR | Python, server | No Node/Rust/browser/C ABI. Training framework first, huge surface |
| RapidOCR | Multi-language, as *separate ports* | Behaviour drifts between the Python, C++, Java and .NET versions |
| oar-ocr | Rust only | No Python/Node bindings, no shipped WASM |
| retto | Rust only, det+rec only | No bindings, no layout |
| client-ocr | Browser only | No server, no native |
| ML Kit (Google Lens) | Mobile only, closed weights | Cannot self-host; 5 scripts only |
| MinerU / marker / docling | Python, GPU-leaning | Licence traps, heavy installs |

Nobody ships one engine that runs identically everywhere. This is llama.cpp's
playbook applied to OCR: llama.cpp won on portability and zero dependencies, not
on inference math.

**No OpenCV. No pyclipper. No PaddlePaddle.** The convex hull, minimum-area
rectangle, polygon offset and contour tracing are ~450 lines of tested C++,
because a 300 MB dependency tree would defeat the point of an 11 MB tier.

## What you get

**Three device tiers.** A size axis, not a licence axis, every model naina ships
is Apache-2.0 and safe for commercial use.

| Tier | det | rec | layout | Total | Target | Charset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tiny` | 1.8 MB | 4.5 MB | 4.9 MB | **≈ 11 MB** | Browser, phone, Pi Zero | 6,904 (CJK + Latin) |
| `small` | 9.9 MB | 21.2 MB | 23.5 MB | **≈ 55 MB** | Laptop, Pi 5, mobile app | 18,708 (50 languages) |
| `medium` | 62.0 MB | 76.6 MB | 130.5 MB | **≈ 269 MB** | Server, desktop | 18,708 (50 languages) |

PaddleOCR ships no ONNX build of the small layout models, so naina converts them
itself, byte-deterministically, and verified per-column against the Paddle
original. Without that, layout would exist only at the 269 MB tier and an 11 MB
browser build could not describe document structure. See
[`tools/paddle2onnx_layout.py`](tools/paddle2onnx_layout.py).

**Every binding over one C ABI**, so behaviour cannot drift between languages:

| Binding | Status | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C / C++ | ✅ | `naina.h`, the contract every other binding targets |
| Python | ✅ published | `pip install naina` |
| Rust | ✅ published | `cargo add naina` |
| Flutter | ✅ published | `flutter pub add naina`, Android verified on device, iOS unproven |
| WASM / browser | ✅ published | `npm i @jvoltci/naina-wasm`, or [use it online](https://lognjais.github.io/naina/) |
| Node / TypeScript | ✅ published | `npm i @jvoltci/naina`, needs a local toolchain to build on install |
| MCP (for LLM tools) | ✅ | [`mcp/`](mcp/), two tools, ten scripts, verified over stdio |

**Weights are mirrored, not borrowed.** naina fetches from
[its own release](https://github.com/lognjais/naina/releases/tag/models-v1), not
from upstream hosting, so an upstream re-tag or deletion cannot break installs.
Every file is pinned by sha256, so a corrupted or substituted download fails
closed rather than producing silently wrong output. Provenance for each artifact
is recorded in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) and as a `source_url` in the manifest.

## Benchmarks

Real measurements, not vendor claims.

**End-to-end, `tiny` tier, Apple M3 Pro**, rendered text fixture, 480×140:

| Line | Recognised | Recognition conf | Detection score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `HELLO WORLD` | 0.967 | 0.899 |
| 2 | `naina 2026` | 1.000 | 0.925 |

Reproduce: `ctest --preset macos-arm64 -R test_ocr_e2e --output-on-failure`

**Full pages, measured during development**, same core, four platforms:

| Where | Page | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native, macOS arm64, `medium` | A4 academic, 1240×1754 | 33 lines @ 0.99, **14/14 regions correctly labelled** |
| Browser (WASM + ort-web), `tiny` | the same page | 33 lines @ 0.99, correct `#`/`##` structure |
| Browser, `devanagari` | Sanskrit/Hindi page, 1585×2353 | 87 lines @ 0.93, 2731 Devanagari codepoints |
| Android arm64 emulator, `tiny` | the A4 page | 33 lines @ 0.992 |
| Browser, `el` / `cyrillic` | rendered text | `Ελληνικά κείμενο 2026`, `Русский текст 2026`, exact |

**Browser is close to native, not bit-identical**, and that boundary is measured:
on the A4 page at `tiny`, native produced 35 lines and WASM 33, with 33
character-identical. One marginal blob landed on the other side of DBNet's 0.3
threshold because arm64 NEON and WASM SIMD kernels differ in the last float bits.

## Status

**v0.2.1.** The honest state:

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| C ABI, `naina_read`, page accessors, staging plan, stage-level access | ✅ |
| Model registry, manifest-driven, sha256-verified, tier + language fallback | ✅ |
| Detection, PP-OCRv6 det, DBNet decode | ✅ |
| Recognition, PP-OCRv6/v5 rec, CTC greedy decode, **ten alphabets** | ✅ |
| Layout → structured markdown, column-aware reading order | ✅ |
| Geometry, convex hull, min-area rect, polygon offset, no OpenCV | ✅ |
| Browser, WASM core + onnxruntime-web, PDF, offline | ✅ |
| Web app + docs live at [lognjais.github.io/naina](https://lognjais.github.io/naina/) | ✅ |
| ONNX Runtime backend | ✅ |
| Android on-device (Flutter) | ✅ 33 lines at 0.992 on a real page |
| iOS | ⚠️ podspec written, never built or run |
| WebGPU | ⚠️ off by default, it silently drops layout, see [limits](https://lognjais.github.io/naina/doc/limits/) |
| NCNN backend | ⚠️ compiles, but `FindNCNN.cmake` does not locate a brew install |
| Recognition batching (one strip per call today) | ⚠️ correct but unoptimised |
| Detecting a script mismatch rather than trusting the caller | ❌ |
| Cross-binding parity enforced in CI | ❌ v1.0 |

**15 C++ tests, 13 Rust, 11 Flutter FFI, 3 Android on-device, 6 Python, 6 Node,
plus a real-browser end-to-end suite.** CI builds on Linux (gcc + clang) and
macOS arm64, and the release matrix covers Linux x64/arm64 and macOS
arm64/x86_64.

**Platform floors**, inherited from ONNX Runtime and `std::aligned_alloc` rather
than chosen: macOS **13.3+**, glibc **2.28+**, Android **API 28+**.

**Not supported, deliberately:** handwriting (PP-OCRv6 is weak at it and claiming
otherwise would be dishonest), autoregressive VLM parsing, training, and
chart/formula semantic extraction.

## Install

Not yet on PyPI or npm, see the note at the top. Build from source:

```bash
cmake --preset macos-arm64           # or linux-x86_64, linux-arm64, windows-x86_64
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64
ctest --preset macos-arm64
```

Requires CMake ≥ 3.24, a C++20 compiler, `yaml-cpp`, `libcurl`, and ONNX Runtime.

naina ships **no image decoder** on purpose, it takes raw pixels. Use Pillow,
OpenCV, `sharp`, or anything else that hands you a buffer.

## Environment

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `NAINA_CACHE` | Where weights are cached. Default `~/.cache/naina/models` |
| `NAINA_OFFLINE=1` | Disable network; use only what is already cached |
| `NAINA_REGISTRY` | Path to `registry.yaml`. Both bindings set this automatically |

## MCP server

An agent can read documents through naina directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "naina": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@jvoltci/naina-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Two tools: `read_document` (markdown) and `read_document_detailed` (per-line
text, confidence, quads). See [`mcp/README.md`](mcp/README.md).

Reading a page carries no session state, so the server is written stateless,
which is what MCP spec revision 2026-07-28 formalised. Note that the current
SDK (`1.30.0`) only negotiates up to `2025-11-25`; the newer revision is a
dependency bump away, not a rewrite.

## The name

*naina* (नैना) means **eyes** in Hindi. The library reads.

It began as a face-recognition runtime under the same name. That work is
preserved on the [`face-stack`](https://github.com/lognjais/naina/tree/face-stack)
branch, and the engine it produced, C ABI, backend abstraction, manifest-driven
model loader, is what made this pivot cheap.
