```dart
final dir  = await getApplicationSupportDirectory();
final root = '${dir.path}/naina';

// Fetches ~11 MB once. Returns immediately afterwards.
await NainaModels.stage(modelsRoot: root);

final naina = await Naina.open(modelsRoot: root);
final page = naina.readRgbSync(rgb, width: w, height: h);
print(page.text);
naina.close();
```

Runs entirely on the device over FFI to naina's C++ core — no network calls, no
API key. The same core and the same PP-OCRv6 models as naina's Python and Node
packages.

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  naina: ^0.2.0
```

## Model weights

Call `NainaModels.stage` once before `Naina.open`. It downloads ~11 MB for the
default tier and is a no-op once the files are present.

```dart
await NainaModels.stage(
  modelsRoot: root,
  language: 'devanagari',                      // optional
  onProgress: (p) => print('${(p.fraction * 100).round()}%'),
);
```

Dart does the fetching because the Android core has no libcurl — the NDK ships
none — exactly as JavaScript fetches for the browser. It does **not** decide
where files go: `naina_staging_plan` in the C core returns both the URLs and the
paths, so the cache layout has one definition and the core still sha256-verifies
every file.

`modelsRoot` is required on mobile: the app sandbox cannot write to the default
`~/.cache`, where `~` does not even expand because there is no `HOME`.

Needs `INTERNET` permission on Android for the first run.

## Getting RGB bytes

naina ships no image decoder — Flutter already has one.

```dart
import 'dart:ui' as ui;

Future<(Uint8List, int, int)> decodeToRgb(Uint8List fileBytes) async {
  final codec = await ui.instantiateImageCodec(fileBytes);
  final frame = await codec.getNextFrame();
  final image = frame.image;

  final rgba = await image.toByteData(format: ui.ImageByteFormat.rawRgba);
  final src = rgba!.buffer.asUint8List();

  final rgb = Uint8List(image.width * image.height * 3);
  for (var i = 0, j = 0; i < src.length; i += 4, j += 3) {
    rgb[j] = src[i];
    rgb[j + 1] = src[i + 1];
    rgb[j + 2] = src[i + 2];
  }
  return (rgb, image.width, image.height);
}
```

Decode at native resolution and let naina resize; its resize is the same code on
every platform, so results stay consistent across devices.

## Keep it off the UI thread

A full page takes noticeable time. `readRgbSync` runs on the calling isolate, so
use a background isolate for anything user-facing:

```dart
final page = await readRgbInIsolate(rgb, width: w, height: h);
```

That helper opens its own context and so reloads the models on each call. For
repeated reads, keep one long-lived isolate.

## Tiers

| Tier | Weights | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `NainaTier.tiny` *(default)* | ~11 MB | phones |
| `NainaTier.small` | ~54 MB | tablets, or when accuracy matters more than size |

A tier picks model size, not capability.

## Limitations

**Unsupported scripts return confident nonsense.** The character set covers Latin
and CJK; there is no Devanagari. A Devanagari page comes back as plausible Latin
at around 0.75 confidence, because `confidence` measures certainty within the
model's own alphabet and cannot express "not in my alphabet". Check the expected
language before calling naina rather than relying on confidence.

**Handwriting is weak.** PP-OCRv6 is trained on print.

**Text only.** Layout structure and markdown exist in the core and are exposed by
naina's Python, Node and browser packages, not yet here.

**`arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` only.** No 32-bit ABIs.

## Status

**Android is verified on a device.** On an arm64 emulator: 4 weight files staged,
then a real A4 page read as **33 lines at 0.992 mean confidence** — the same
result the native build gives. `libnaina.so` (1.4 MB) and `libonnxruntime.so`
ship in the APK. Three on-device integration tests pass.

Also verified on the host: analysis clean, every C symbol resolves, and the FFI
struct layout matches the C compiler's (`naina_config` is 48 bytes on both sides),
with image wrapping, context lifecycle and ABI v1 compatibility exercised against
a real `libnaina`.

**iOS is not verified.** The podspec is written but has never been built or run.

Requires **Android API 28+**: the core allocates with `std::aligned_alloc`, which
Android's libc only declares from 28.

## The name

*naina* means **eyes** in Hindi.
